                        <p>A high school project gave me the realization that hard work beats talent, and that anything is achievable when one puts their mind to it. This is the motto I live by today.</p>

                        <p>I am refreshing my entire brand identity, I have started working out, and I'm learning how to maintain good PR. I applied for College at UNG, pursuing a bachelor’s degree in business and design. As of 2025, I plan on turning my side hobby into a business and exploring other businesses. This will be the biggest move of the year.</p>
                        <p>I own <strong>dreams timeskip</strong> and partner with channels to help them reach their potential. I am also planning to open a local car detailing business later this year; I have already had 3 clients and am currently planning the full launch and marketing strategy.</p>
                        <p>I started two channels, achieving over 1,000 views on both, and amassed 200 followers in a few months. I got into freelance for design and video editing and started doing cold calls to acquire clients, putting all my skills to use while still working at Arby’s.</p>
                        <p>I now manage two teams: one which runs a project started in 2019 (a Minecraft server hosting hundreds of players, which is now a team working to release the next sequel) and one that manages our online communities.</p>
                        <p>I also decided to launch a website and develop my math and coding skills further, along with my design skills. Now with college, I am seeking new opportunities in design and sales. I am searching for a job that can generate income to sustain my college, life, and business/freelance initial startup.</p>

                <!-- Entry: Arby's -->
                <article class="fade-in-section p-6 rounded-lg hover:bg-gray-900">
                    <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-1">JUL 2024 - PRESENT · MANAGEMENT</p>
                    <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold text-gray-100 mb-4">Shift Manager, Arby's</h2>
                    <div class="prose prose-custom max-w-none">
                        <p>In 2024, a fast-food chain named Arby’s finished construction. I had used online job boards and applied to over 200 jobs, all with little success, but I never let that bring me down. I know hard work always wins and will back that up. So realizing the pattern, I switched my strategy. Instead of doing what everyone else is doing, I went to the store every day and asked for a manager, until I got across an amazing general manager. I applied that day and scheduled an interview in just three days, resulting in my being hired as a Team Member.</p>
                        <p>My reasoning behind this was to prove to myself I could achieve what others wouldn’t dream of and acquire a Shift Manager position. But I knew I would have to stand out. Since I had no experience in the fast-food industry (besides my culinary experience from High School) I knew it would be difficult. I started in Drive-Through; eventually, I learned the POS system, how to advertise to customers, how to upsell, and how to use specific wording to raise my chances of making a sale. I learned how to work with a team in a fast-paced environment.</p>
                        <p>Eventually, we started getting understaffed, but instead of losing hope where others would, I saw the opportunity and took it. As most of our staff quit, leaving just a few people, and seeing my competition, I decided I would work the hardest I ever had. I learned over seven working team positions in a few months, from things like working the fry station to making sandwiches, to stocking the inventory and freezer. I also learned how to organize items and how to track them using company software. I did the jobs no one wanted to do. I came in on days no one else wanted to. I showed up, put in the effort, and it paid off, eventually leading me to a Shift Manager position.</p>
                        <p>I went into training at a different location, making up to an hour drive. This taught me time management and how to schedule things, a skill I heavily rely on. I have been on time 99% of the time, aside from emergencies, in which I gave my employers a notice ASAP. I started networking with other shift managers, learning from their mistakes, learning their techniques, and how to succeed. After my training, I came back with skills in accounting, managing money, a better understanding of company and file structures, how to delegate tasks in a fast-paced environment, how to scout out good employees for hire, and an understanding of my duties and responsibilities.</p>

                        <p>As Shift Manager, I managed daily shift operations and led a team of up to 15 crew members in a fast-paced environment, focusing on operational excellence, team development, and customer satisfaction.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Team Leadership & Supervision:</strong> Directed and coached diverse teams, delegating tasks to ensure efficient workflow and consistently meeting performance goals.</li>
                            <li><strong>Employee Training & Development:</strong> Onboarded and trained new staff on point-of-sale systems, food safety protocols, and customer service standards, enhancing team capabilities and speed.</li>
                            <li><strong>Operational Management:</strong> Executed opening and closing procedures, including facility security, equipment checks, and ensuring compliance with all health and company regulations.</li>

                        <p>I also learned skills from site managers that helped me reason and determine risk. This was across out-of-state locations. No job was the same, requiring you to be hardworking and always adapting; this helped me further my drive and help me set a new standard for excellency. This was an opportunity that changed my outlook forever and made me take the next bold step of my career.</p>

                        <p>During my time at PA&K as a File Clerk, I also picked up the skill of file management, using financial systems like QuickBooks, and learned how to use the Microsoft 365 Suite (Outlook, Excel, Word, Teams, PowerPoint, OneNote).

I oversaw and worked alongside the entire workflow from ideas, to branding, to designing, to labeling, to sauce development. I was crucial to the process of selecting the freshest ingredients and creating the sauce. I worked with external teams to help bring our designs to life and constantly checked on the process, making sure they met my standards and asking for revisions as needed. Then along with my team, we created a captivating story for our brand, and in the end, we ended up getting 1st place.</p>
                        <p>This wasn’t achieved without sacrifices; we spent double the time other teams spent, held out-of-school meetings, did market research (as artificial intelligence chatbots did not exist yet), and developed a product we deemed worthy of excellence.</p>

The trade-off was my GPA, but that was a hit I was willing to take, as I knew as long as I performed in college my grades would speak for themselves.</p>
